Provide a CSS selector to only monitor  portions of a page you are interested in. You may supply * to monitor the entire page, but you may receive alerts for trivial changes. Email alerts are sent to the primary email address on your DocumentCloud account.  To get started, copy the bookmarklet <a href=\"javascript:(function(){document.body.appendChild(document.createElement('script')).src='https://documentcloud-klaxon.s3.amazonaws.com/inject.js';})();\">Add to Klaxon</a> to your bookmarks,  visit a page you are looking to monitor, and then click on the bookmark to activate Klaxon. </p>",
